# Shooting Dice

## A C# Exercise

### The Story

You are building a dice game. Like any good game, your game should have players. But you don't just want a single kind of player. No. You want your game to be interesting, so you want many types of players.

The goal of this exercise is to create classes to represent those various types of players and to test them out in `Program.cs`

### The Setup

1. use this template to create your own repo
1. clone your repo locally

### The Task

1. Read the existing code. Add or modify comments as needed to help you understand it.
1. Add code to each "Player" class to make it behave the way it should.
    * See the comment above each class for instructions. 
    * Complete the classes in the order specified below.
1. After completing each class, use it to create one or more Player objects in `Program.cs`. Write code to test these new objects.
1. Add the new Player object(s) to the `players` list, so they will be passed to the `PlayMany()` method.

> **NOTE:** Make sure to **FULLY TEST** each class immediately after you write it. Do **NOT** write all the classes before you test.

#### You should complete the classes in this order:

1. `SmackTalkingPlayer`
1. `OneHigherPlayer`
1. `HumanPlayer`
1. `CreativeSmackTalkingPlayer`
1. `SoreLoserPlayer`
1. `UpperHalfPlayer`
1. `SoreLoserUpperHalfPlayer`
